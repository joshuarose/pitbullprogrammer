# Chiara Ghost Theme

Thanks for purchasing Chiara. I hope you like. Actually, most stuff should work as intended by Ghost.

Dont forget to change the Google Analytics account to yours in this line of code, which can be found in default.hbs:

ga('create', 'UA-47305801-1', 'svenread.com');

Furthermore you should customize the content of the <head> tag to your needs.

Next you can add your social media accounts & custom links inside index.hbs.

In case you have any question, please let me know on me@svenread.com

Have fun.

bye Sven
